# Django Tutorial - Ornella's version

After having done the tutorial, I decided to do it again by adding a new table in the database called topics.

# New Features!

  - New class called Topics
  - In views I changed the classes by functions (for beginners like me, this is a change that helps us to understand).
  - What is a site without home?, I had to add it. This led me to change everything from urls.py
  - A bit of Bootstrap does not hurt anyone (sorry I'm very visual).
  
# New Features 1.0
  
  - Topic administration  

# What's coming

  - Create admin template (I hope to put security and the whole thing).
  - Automated testing (something that I should definitely learn and improve).
  - In the configuration file that the user name and password is not mine, you definitely need to improve.
  
  
**The important thing is to learn**
