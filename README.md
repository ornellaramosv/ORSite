# Django Tutorial - Ornella's version

After having done the tutorial, I decided to do it again by adding a new table in the database called topics.

# New Features

  - New class called Topics
  - In views I changed the classes by functions (for beginners like me, this is a change that helps us to understand).
  - What is a site without home?, I had to add it. This led me to change everything from urls.py
  - A bit of Bootstrap does not hurt anyone (sorry I'm very visual).
  
# New Features 1.0
  
  - Topic administration
  - Login/Logout   

# New Features 2.0

  - Sign Up (Adding the other values: First name, last name and email)

# What's coming

  - Sessions manage
  - Resset password

**The important thing is to learn**
